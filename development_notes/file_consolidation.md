# File Consolidation

**Date:** April 14, 2025

## Changes Implemented

- Consolidated duplicate training data generation scripts
- Used the modular architecture from `generate_training_data_modular.py` but kept the original filename `generate_training_data.py`
- The original file was backed up at `temp/generate_training_data.py.original`
- This change simplifies maintenance and ensures consistent behavior

## Benefits

- Single source of truth for training data generation
- Leverages the modular architecture with better language support
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Removes duplication in the codebase
- Easier to maintain and extend

## Next Steps

- Update any documentation or scripts that might reference `generate_training_data_modular.py`
- Consider implementing the mixed precision training (as noted in the improvements.md)
- Add tests for the consolidated script
