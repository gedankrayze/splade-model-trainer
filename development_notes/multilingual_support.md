# Multilingual Support Implementation

**Date:** April 14, 2025

## Background
- The original `generate_training_data.py` script was creating mixed language output (English/German) when processing German documents
- The file had grown too large (syntax errors when modifying) and was difficult to maintain
- Needed a solution that would be extensible for future language support

## Implementation
- Restructured the training data generator into a modular architecture:
  - `src/generator/` package with specialized modules
  - `src/generate_training_data_modular.py` as the new entry point
  - Each module has clear responsibility (API, templates, processors, etc.)

- Added language support via multiple approaches:
  - Language-specific templates in German (better than just giving instructions)
  - `--language` parameter to specify the desired language
  - `--detect-language` option for automatic detection
  - Pre-translated system prompts for better output quality

- Added tasks to the Taskfile:
  - `prepare-with-ollama-lang` for specific language 
  - `prepare-with-ollama-auto` for automatic detection

## Testing
- Created test German documents in `temp/test_german/`
- Generated test data with qwen2.5 model on Ollama
- Confirmed high-quality German output with consistent language use
- Examined contrastive strategies and technical terminology quality

## Documentation
- Added `docs/multilingual_support.md` with usage instructions
- Added README in the generator package for development guidance
- Updated Taskfile.train.yaml with the new tasks

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more language templates (Spanish, French, etc.)
- Improve language detection for more accurate results
- Create automated testing for language consistency
- Consider documenting this as a case study in an article

## Notes to Self
- The modular structure makes it much easier to add new features
- Using pre-translated templates is more effective than just instructing the model
- qwen2.5 handles German well, but test other models for comparison
- This approach could be applied to other parts of the system for better maintainability
