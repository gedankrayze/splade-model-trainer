# Gedank Rayze SPLADE Model Trainer: Best Practices

This document outlines optimized approaches and best practices to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of your
SPLADE model training and deployment workflow.

## Data Preparation

### Document Collection

- **Optimal chunking**: Keep chunks between 500-2000 characters. Too small = insufficient context; too large = diluted
  relevance signals
- **Content overlap**: Include 10-20% overlap between chunks to avoid splitting key information
- **Pre-processing**: Apply consistent normalization (lowercase, punctuation removal, etc.) to both training data and
  inference queries
- **Balance**: Ensure your training data has diverse document types representing your actual retrieval corpus

### Training Data Generation

- **Query diversity**: Generate a variety of query types (questions, keywords, natural language) that reflect real user
  behavior
- **Hard negatives**: Include semantically similar but incorrect documents as negative examples
- **Validation split**: Maintain a 80/20 or 90/10 train/validation split with minimal content overlap
- **Quality over quantity**: 1,000 high-quality examples often outperform 10,000 poor ones

## Model Training

### Hyperparameter Optimization

- **Regularization coefficients**: Start with low values (`lambda_d` = `lambda_q` = 0.0001) and adjust based on
  validation loss
- **Learning rate**: 2e-5 to 5e-5 typically works well for fine-tuning
- **Batch size**: Use the largest that fits in memory (typically 8-32) for more stable gradients
- **Epochs**: 3-5 epochs are usually sufficient; use early stopping based on validation loss

### Computational Efficiency

- **Mixed precision training**: Enable FP16 training to reduce memory usage and increase throughput
- **Gradient accumulation**: If hardware-limited, accumulate gradients over multiple batches
- **Progressive batch size**: Start with a smaller batch size and increase as training progresses
- **Checkpoint selectively**: Save checkpoints based on validation metrics rather than at fixed intervals

## Evaluation and Tuning

### Metrics to Prioritize

- **Recall@k**: Measures ability to retrieve relevant documents in top-k results
- **NDCG@10**: Evaluates ranking quality for top results
- **MRR**: Mean Reciprocal Rank indicates average position of first relevant result
- **Query latency**: Critical for production systems; target under 100ms per query

### Iterative Improvement

- **Error analysis**: Manually review cases where the model performs poorly
- **Data augmentation**: Add examples targeting model weaknesses
- **Query reformulation**: Add training data with different phrasings for the same information need

## Deployment Considerations

### Efficiency Optimizations

- **Quantization**: Quantize model weights to INT8 for faster inference with minimal quality loss
- **Vocabulary pruning**: Remove unused vocabulary tokens to reduce model size
- **Batch processing**: Process queries in batches when possible
- **Document pre-encoding**: Pre-compute and store document vectors for lookup at query time

### Scaling

- **Indexing strategy**: Use inverted indices for efficient retrieval with sparse representations
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Combine SPLADE (recall) with a cross-encoder reranker (precision) for best results
- **Distributed inference**: Shard document index across multiple servers for handling large collections

## Integration Tips

### Pre and Post Processing

- **Query expansion**: Apply simple rule-based expansion for common abbreviations or synonyms
- **Document segmentation**: Consider semantic segmentation rather than fixed-length chunks
- **Filtering**: Apply metadata filters before semantic search to reduce candidate pool

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- **A/B testing**: Compare model versions on a subset of traffic before full deployment
- **Relevance feedback**: Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement
- **Periodic retraining**: Fine-tune on new data every 3-6 months to capture distribution shifts

## Hardware-Specific Optimizations

### GPU Acceleration

- **CUDA optimizations**: Enable CUDA graph optimization for repeated operations
- **Batch size tuning**: Find optimal batch size for your specific GPU model
- **Memory management**: Monitor GPU memory usage and adjust max_length accordingly

### Apple Silicon (MPS)

- **M-series optimization**: When using MPS backend, smaller batch sizes (4-8) often perform better
- **Mixed precision**: Use float16 precision for significant speedups on Apple Silicon

### CPU Deployment

- **Thread optimization**: Set appropriate OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS environment variables
- **Quantization**: Use INT8 quantization for up to 4x speedup with minimal quality loss
- **Batch size**: Smaller batches (2-4) typically work better on CPU

By following these best practices, you can significantly improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of your SPLADE
model training and deployment pipeline.
