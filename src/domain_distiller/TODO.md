# Domain Distiller: Future Improvements and Features

This document outlines potential enhancements to consider for future development of Domain Distiller.

## Advanced Generation Strategies

- [ ] **Chain-of-Thought Document Generation**: Implement multi-step reasoning process where the LLM outlines key points, develops content, and self-reviews
- [ ] **Contrastive Pair Generation**: Generate negative examples with intentional similarities to positive examples but key differences that make them non-relevant
- [ ] **Self-Critique and Improvement Loop**: Add feedback loop for LLM to evaluate, critique, and improve generated examples before finalizing

## Enhanced Customization Options

- [ ] **Difficulty Stratification**: Allow users to specify desired proportions of simple, medium, and complex queries/documents
- [ ] **Industry-Specific Templates**: Add more specialized domain templates (pharmaceuticals, aerospace, manufacturing, cybersecurity)
- [ ] **Custom Prompting Strategies**: Enable users to define their own prompt templates or override specific generation prompts

## Quality and Evaluation Features

- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**: Support workflows where samples can be flagged for manual review
- [ ] **Semantic Diversity Analysis**: Analyze diversity of generated data to identify gaps or overrepresented concepts
- [ ] **Automatic Benchmark Creation**: Generate evaluation datasets with more rigorous quality controls

## Integration and Tooling

- [ ] **Continuous Generation Pipeline**: Build system that generates data, trains models, evaluates, and uses insights to guide further generation
- [ ] **Interactive GUI**: Create web interface for non-technical users to configure generation parameters and visualize results
- [ ] **Vector Database Integration**: Add support for directly storing generated data in vector databases for immediate testing

## Technical Improvements

- [ ] **Streaming Results**: Implement streaming output to see examples as they're generated rather than waiting for batch completion
- [ ] **Cost Estimation and Budget Controls**: Estimate API costs beforehand and enforce budget limits during generation
- [ ] **Distributed Processing**: Support distributed processing across multiple machines for large-scale generation
- [ ] **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching to avoid regenerating content during iterative refinement

## Specialized Use Cases

- [ ] **Few-Shot Learning Support**: Allow users to provide exemplar data to guide the generation process
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer**: Enable generation of training data that bridges multiple domains
- [ ] **Multilingual Parallel Data**: Generate the same content in multiple languages to create parallel datasets

## Research Directions

- [ ] **LLM Selection and Comparison**: Compare quality of data generated by different LLMs for various domains
- [ ] **Synthetic Data Watermarking**: Implement subtle watermarking in generated data to track usage and impact
- [ ] **Training Data Quality Metrics**: Develop metrics specifically for evaluating synthetic training data quality
